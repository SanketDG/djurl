# Modern Django Tooling

This is a series of posts at an _attempt_ to take a very simple Django project
that was written a few years ago, and try to improve the tooling using modern
techniques.

## Introduction

## Use poetry for dependency management (or pip-tools)

## Easy development environments with Docker and docker-compose

## Integrate static typing with `mypy` and `django-stubs`

## Easy linting with `flake8` and `wemake-python-stylguide`

## Opinionated code formatting using _Black_

## Automate typing/linting/formatting on commit using `pre-commit`

## py.test and GitHub CI integration

## Multiple Deployment Options with Herkou and Cloud Run.
